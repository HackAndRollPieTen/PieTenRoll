# Project Overview
This telegram bot project called GroupTogether has the aim of allowing university students to find groupmates for their modules. Our inspiration for this project stems from student bidding alone or students not having enough people to form a group. Our telegram bot hopes to lower the difficulty in finding group members and finding groups that students are able to join. With this mission in mind, we hope that through our bot these pain points are addressed and students are able to seamlessly find a team for their modules.
