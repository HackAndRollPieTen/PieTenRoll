# Project Overview
Our group, PieTenRoll has decided to work on a telegram bot project called GroupTogether, which aims to allow university students to find groupmates for their modules. The inspiration for this project stems from student bidding alone or students not having enough people to form a group. In this bot, we hope to lower the difficulty in finding group members and finding groups that students are able to join. With this mission in mind, we hope that through our bot these pain points are addressed and students are able to seamlessly find teams for their modules.
